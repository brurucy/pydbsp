"""Compute. Value rules per node, separate from progress tracking.

While :mod:`pydbsp.progress` describes WHERE in time each node is
settled (frontier algebra), this module describes WHAT each node
computes at a given timestamp (value algebra). The two layers align
on ``NodeId``: node ``i`` has both a :class:`ProgressRule` and a
:class:`ComputeRule`.

A compute rule is a **pure function** of timestamp + pre-bound input
readers + context. It carries no caching state. Memoisation, slot
tables, and scheduling belong to a separate evaluator layer.

**Closed vs. non-closed operations.** Some operators are closed in a
single value type ``V`` (``Delay``, ``Integrate``, ``Differentiate``,
``CausalAggregate``. They need a group to provide identity / add /
neg). Others map between different types (``Map`` from ``V_in`` to
``V_out``, ``ZipWith`` from ``V_l × V_r`` to ``V_out``). Closed shapes
carry their own :class:`AbelianGroupOperation` reference. The shared
:class:`ComputeCtx` only holds the lattice (V-independent).

**Wiring is the evaluator's job.** A compute rule does *not* know about
``NodeId``\\s. It consumes a tuple of pre-bound readers in the same
order as the progress layer declares its inputs. The evaluator
constructs the readers (one per upstream node) and threads them
through the rule.

**Primitives vs. compositions.** This module declares value rules for
the algebraic primitives:

* :class:`Get`. Atomic read at ``t``. Source nodes use this directly
  and every other shape composes it as its building block.
* :class:`Apply`. Generic N-ary apply: ``f`` over all readers at ``t``. Readers may have heterogeneous types.
* :class:`Map`, :class:`ZipWith`. Typed 1-ary / 2-ary specialisations
  with separate input/output type parameters.
* :class:`Prev`. Read the single input at the axis predecessor. Group
  identity at the axis bottom (closed in ``V``).
* :class:`Constant`. Place the input value at ``t_k = 0`` on a new
  axis, group identity elsewhere. Output arity is the input's plus one
  (closed in ``V``).
* :class:`Foldl`. Causal left fold: ``self(t) = op(input(t),
  self(predecessor(t, axis)))`` (closed in ``V``).
* :class:`Sum`. Specialisation of ``Foldl`` with ``op = group.add``:
  the running-sum recurrence ``self(t) = add(input(t), self(t-1))``.
* :class:`Diff`. Composition of ``ZipWith(add)``, ``Map(neg)``, and
  ``Prev`` (closed in ``V``).
