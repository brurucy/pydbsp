## Introduction
This library provides an implementation of the [DBSP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16684) language for incremental streaming
computation. It is a tool primarily meant for **research**. See it as the [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) of streaming.

DBSP is differential dataflow's less expressive successor. It is a competing theory and framework to other stream processing systems such as Flink
and Spark.

Its value is better understood in that it is capable of transforming "batch" iterative relational queries into "streaming incremental ones".

You will see it in action in the following example.

## Example

```python

```

```python

```

```python

There many more examples living in each `test_*.py` file.
